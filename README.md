# Prescription-Pattern-Analysis

1. Introduction
   The Prescription Pattern Analysis project aims to analyze the patterns of administering or prescribing a specific drug, referred to as the "Target Drug," to patients. The goal is to identify dominant patterns in which the drug is prescribed and visualize these patterns over time. The project utilizes clustering and unsupervised techniques to extract insights from the prescription data.

2. Problem Statement
   The primary objective is to analyze the patterns of administering the "Target Drug" to patients and identify the dominant prescription patterns. The secondary objective is to visualize these patterns on a timeline, where the X-axis represents time (months) and the Y-axis represents the frequency of prescriptions.

3. Dataset
   The project utilizes a dataset containing electronic health records of patients diagnosed with a specific disease. The dataset includes the following columns:
   - Patient-Uid: A unique alphanumeric identifier for each patient
   - Date: The date when a medical event occurred
   - Incident: Describes the type of event, such as drug prescription or symptom occurrence

4. Methodology
   The Prescription Pattern Analysis project can be divided into the following steps:

   a. Data Preparation:
      - Load the dataset and extract the relevant columns.
      - Perform any necessary data cleaning and preprocessing.

   b. Clustering:
      - Encode the categorical "Incident" column using one-hot encoding.
      - Apply a clustering algorithm, such as K-means, to identify dominant prescription patterns.
      - Determine the optimal number of clusters based on domain knowledge or using evaluation metrics.

   c. Visualization:
      - Create a timeline visualization with time on the X-axis (months) and prescription frequency on the Y-axis.
      - Assign each prescription to its corresponding cluster and plot the prescription patterns for each cluster.

5. Implementation
   The Prescription Pattern Analysis project can be implemented using programming languages such as Python. Below are the major libraries and tools that can be utilized:

   - pandas: For data loading, manipulation, and preprocessing.
   - scikit-learn: For clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means) and data preprocessing tasks (e.g., one-hot encoding).
   - matplotlib or seaborn: For creating visualizations, including the timeline plot.

6. Results and Evaluation
   The Prescription Pattern Analysis project provides insights into the dominant patterns of administering the "Target Drug" to patients. The visualization helps to identify the prescription patterns over time, enabling healthcare professionals to understand how the drug is prescribed.

   Evaluation of the clustering results can be performed based on different metrics, such as the silhouette score or within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS), depending on the chosen clustering algorithm. The quality of the results can also be assessed by comparing the prescription patterns with domain knowledge or expert opinions.

7. Conclusion
   The Prescription Pattern Analysis project offers valuable insights into the patterns of administering the "Target Drug" to patients. By applying clustering techniques and visualizing the prescription patterns, healthcare professionals can gain a deeper understanding of how the drug is prescribed and potentially make informed decisions regarding treatment strategies.

   Further improvements and extensions to the project can include exploring additional clustering algorithms, integrating other features from the dataset, or incorporating advanced visualization techniques.
